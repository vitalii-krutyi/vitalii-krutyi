- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vitalii Krutyi.

I am interested to work with you to realize your hopes for future iOS applications.
From my side, I promise to include all my developing skills and provide you with a good product and for myself more good practice and good feedback from You.

I have experience with different kinds of applications, one of them the social application, which You can see on the App Store - "Hoozie"(https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hoozie/id1488219149).

Also, the last application which I created was an app for pilates(https://woobody.com/).

I have experience with next frameworks:
WebRTC, Firebase, OpenTok, FSCalendar, SDWebImage, Alamofire...

I have 1 year of manually testing experience. 
I can write tests case and test the application by them.

- ðŸ“« I'm open to your suggestions -  v.krutyi@gmail.com
